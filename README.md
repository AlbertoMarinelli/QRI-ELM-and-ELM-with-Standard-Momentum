# QRI-ELM-and-ELM-with-Standard-Momentum
In this project it is used a Machine Learning model based on a method called Extreme Learning, with the employment of L2-regularization. In particular, a comparison was carried out between: (A1) which is a variant of incremental extreme learning machine that is QRIELM and (A2) which is a standard momentum descent approach, applied to the ELM.
